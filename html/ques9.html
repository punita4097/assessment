        <h1>Doctype:</h1>
        <p>
            The "!DOCTYPE" declaration must be the very first thing in your HTML document, before the <html> tag.
        </p>
        <p>
            The "!DOCTYPE" declaration is not an HTML tag; it is an instruction to the web browser about what version of HTML the page is written in.
        </p>
        <p>
            Always add the "!DOCTYPE" declaration to your HTML documents, so that the browser knows what type of document to expect.
